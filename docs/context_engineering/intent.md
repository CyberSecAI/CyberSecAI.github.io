## Prioritized Intent Engineering Steps for Agentic AI

### 1) Define Mission Intent
* Capture the high-level purpose clearly in one sentence.  
* Translate organizational goals into actionable, testable intents.  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Provides north star and scope boundary.  

---

### 2) Refine Operational Intents
* Break down mission intent into sub-intents for users, constraints, and environments.  
* Maintain traceability from mission → operations → actions.  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Ensures consistency and coverage.  

---

### 3) Codify Intent as Artifacts
* Express intents in prompts, policies, workflows, and tests.  
* Automate checks for intent–artifact alignment.  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Makes intent durable, auditable, and governable.  

---

### 4) Engineer for Adaptability
* Accept that intents evolve with context and feedback.  
* Version and audit “living intents.”  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Keeps systems aligned over time.  

---

### 5) Assure Intent Realization
* Validate that agent behavior matches stated intent.  
* Use red-teaming, monitoring, and independent verification.  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Provides assurance evidence and trust.  

---

### 6) Balance Speed & Reflection
* Alternate **rapid AI bursts** with structured reflection (per Muness).  
* Ask: is this necessary, sufficient, aligned?  
* 🔑 **Impact:** Avoids “vibe coding,” drives clarity and outcome-orientation.

## Takeaways
  
!!! success "Key Takeaways"

    * **Intent > Context > Prompt.** The hierarchy starts with clarity of purpose.  
    * **Explicit and Testable.** Intents must be traceable from mission to action.  
    * **Assurance is critical.** Agent behavior must be independently validated.  
    * **Living Intents.** Expect evolution; support versioning and governance.  
    * **Balance exploration with reflection.** Use bursts + checkpoints to avoid drift.
