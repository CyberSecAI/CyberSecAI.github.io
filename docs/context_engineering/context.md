      Reduce what the primary agent sees; delegate everything else to sub-agents or background primaries, with crisp contracts and logs  


    
## Prioritized Context Engineering Steps for Agentic AI

### 1) Minimize the Primary Context (treat it like a cache)

* Keep only: **goal**, **immediate instructions**, **tiny retrieved slice**, **output schema**.
* Keep ephemeral scratchpads for step-by-step reasoning; purge after use.
* Offload history, rules, and big docs to external memory or files.
*  üîë **Impact:** Faster, cheaper, less distracted agent; fewer long-context failure modes.

---

### 2) Write Context Intentionally (don‚Äôt just append everything)

* Clear **system message** for goals, rules, constraints, evaluation criteria.
* Define **output schemas** (JSON/table) and acceptance checks.
* Put canonical facts/API contracts in stable references, not the live window.
* Log key decisions so context can be rebuilt if needed.
*  üîë **Impact:** Prevents bloated prompts; establishes reliable ‚Äúground truth‚Äù.

---

### 3) Select Context Dynamically (quality > quantity)

* Retrieve only what‚Äôs relevant **now** via embeddings/filters.
* Cap retrieval: few high-signal snippets; drop duplicates/stale text.
* Prefer structured facts (tables/JSON) over long prose.
*  üîë **Impact:** Model focuses on the right information; fewer hallucinations.

---

### 4) Use Context Priming (instead of big always-on memory files)

* Create reusable **prime commands** per task (Purpose ‚Üí Read/Fetch ‚Üí Steps ‚Üí Report).
* Keep a **tiny universal core** (guardrails + IO schema) always loaded.
* Prime on demand for bugfix, feature, research, etc.
*  üîë **Impact:** Minimal startup tokens with task-specific readiness.

---

### 5) Kill Always-On Baggage (tools/MCP autoloading)

* Don‚Äôt preload tool packs/MCP servers by default; load **lazily** per task.
* Unload after use; explicitly justify any autoload.
* Audit startup context and remove dead weight.
*  üîë **Impact:** Frees large chunks of window; cuts token waste and latency.

---

### 6) Delegate Heavy Work to **Sub-Agents** (properly)

* One sub-agent = **one job** with a tight **system prompt**.
* Let sub-agents consume **their** windows; return **distilled reports** + artifacts.
* Standard report contract: `{summary, key_facts, risks, artifacts[]}`.
*  üîë **Impact:** Keeps the primary window small while scaling capability.

---

### 7) Delegate Long/Expensive Tasks to **Background Primary Agents**

* Kick off separate agents for crawls, planning, batch edits, evals.
* They write **report files + artifacts**; foreground ingests concise summaries.
* Use this to ‚Äúget out of the loop‚Äù while work continues.
*  üîë **Impact:** Parallelizes work; maintains a lean, responsive main loop.

!!! tip

    [Claude Code CLI God Mode](../software/claude_code.md#claude-code-cli-god-mode) is an example of this, delegating to a different Primary model (that is the best tool for the job.)


---

### 8) Compress Context (mostly outside the window)

* Rolling conversation summaries; hierarchical notes (facts ‚Üí decisions ‚Üí actions).
* Store raw data externally; insert only **pointers + summaries**.
* Heuristic trimming rules (dedupe, last-N, relevance thresholds).
*  üîë **Impact:** Extends effective history without clogging the window.

---

### 9) Isolate Contexts (sandboxing & pipelines)

* Keep runtime state objects and scratchpads **per agent**.
* Avoid leaking sub-agent history into the primary prompt.
* Build multi-agent pipelines with explicit handoffs.
*  üîë **Impact:** Reduces poisoning, distraction, and cross-task conflicts.

---

### 10) Log **Context Bundles** for replay/handoff

* Save `{run_id, primes, reads, tool_calls, key_findings, decisions, outputs, next_steps}`.
* Use bundles to reprime new agents after window blow-ups or for continuity.
* Keep bundles concise‚Äîno verbatim dumps of huge content.
*  üîë **Impact:** Reproducibility and seamless continuation across sessions.

---

### 11) Defend Against Context Failure Modes

* **Poisoning:** verify tool outputs; tag trust levels; gate propagation.
* **Confusion:** filter irrelevant turns; dedupe aggressively.
* **Conflict:** detect/resolve contradictions before composing answers.
*  üîë **Impact:** Higher reliability and fewer cascading errors.

---

### 12) Standardize Schemas & Measure What Matters

* Standard prompt skeletons, report JSON, artifact layout, retrieval policies.
* Track `startup_tokens`, `peak_tokens`, `#agents_spawned`, `attempts_to_success`, `retrieval_hits`.
* Set SLOs (e.g., startup ‚â§10% window, attempts ‚â§3) and alert on drift.
*  üîë **Impact:** Consistency at scale; makes optimization and debugging straightforward.

## Takeaways
  
!!! success "Key Takeaways"

    * **Treat the Context Window Like a CPU Cache, Not a Hard Drive:** The core principle is to keep the primary agent's context minimal and focused‚Äîcontaining only the immediate goal, instructions, and a small slice of relevant data. Offload history, large documents, and non-essential tools to external memory to improve speed, reduce cost, and avoid distraction.
    * **Reduce and Delegate, Don't Accumulate:** Instead of bloating a single agent's context, delegate heavy or specialized tasks to sub-agents or background agents. These agents work in their own isolated contexts and return only concise, distilled reports, enabling complex work without overwhelming the primary agent.
    * **Context Must Be Actively Managed, Not Passively Appended:** Implement dynamic strategies like just-in-time retrieval (RAG), summarization, and context isolation to ensure the model always has high-quality, relevant information. Actively defend against common failure modes like poisoning and confusion by verifying inputs and filtering irrelevant data.
