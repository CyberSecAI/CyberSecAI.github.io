!!! tip "Why Read this Guide?"
    This guide shows how cybersecurity professionals can get up and running quickly with AI tools.

    It's in an initial raw state currently and is largely written by me for me... to organize my play time as I play with, and apply, these tools.
    
    Large Language Models (hosted and open source), and BERT-based language models tools will be covered e.g.
    
    1. NotebookML 
    2. Embeddings for CyberSecurity
    3. BERTopic
    4. SetFIT + LAGoNN
    5. Named Entity Recognition GliNER and CyberSecurity NER models
    6. Prompts and Prompt Techniques applied to Cybersecurity
