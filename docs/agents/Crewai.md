# Building Multi Agent Systems

!!! Overview
    Here we will walk through building a Multi Agent System using CrewAI.

    The [system architecture Mermaid diagram](./Build_agents.md#Architecture) was converted to CrewAI code (using a GPT).

!!! tip
    CrewAI.com has a [Chat with our docs](https://chatg.pt/DWjSBZn) link (ChatGPT agent) which is useful to ask questions e.g.
     
    !!! quote

        explain the different agent parts and what's the difference between system_prompt backstory and goal

    !!! quote "This is a small extract from the response"   

        When defining an agent, each of these parts works together to create a fully functional and contextually aware agent:

        The role is the title or the agentâ€™s job.

        The goal is what the agent is aiming to achieve in a broad sense.

        The backstory adds narrative depth, giving the agent more personality and context.

        The system_prompt provides the specific instructions to execute tasks in real time.
