# Preface 

Language Models are powerful tools that can be applied to CyberSecurity.

I enjoy learning about, playing with, and applying these tools to better solve problems:

* I wrote this guide for me, to organize my thoughts and my play time as I play with, and apply, Language Models.
* I've found by putting something out there, you get something back.
* It's the guide I wish existed already.


This approach worked well for the [Risk-Based Prioritization guide](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisamadden_cybersecurity-riskmanagement-vulnerabilitymanagement-activity-7179915292775452673-5ucc/)...
