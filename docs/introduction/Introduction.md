!!! abstract "About this Guide"

      This guide is in an initial raw state currently and is largely written by me for me... to organize my play time as I play with, and apply, these tools.

      But you might find it useful.

## Overview




## Intended Audience

The intended audience is people wanting to go beyond the hype and basics of Large Language Models.

No prior knowledge is assumed to read the guide - it provides just enough information to understand the advanced topics covered.

A basic knowledge of Jupyter Python is required to run the code (with the data provided or on your data).

## Writing Style
The "writing style" in this guide is succinct, and leads with an opinion, with data and code to back it up i.e. data analysis plots (with source code where possible) and observations and takeaways that you can assess - and apply to your data and environment. This allows the reader to assess the opinion and the code/data and rationale behind it.

Different, and especially opposite, opinions with the data to back them up, are especially welcome! - and will help shape this guide.
