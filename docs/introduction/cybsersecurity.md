# LLMs for CyberSecurity

!!! tip
      LLMs (the subset of GenAI that focus on processing and generating text/language) can be used effectively for many parts of CyberSecurity:

      - anywhere natural language is used from standards, documents, messages, reports, log files 
      - across different modes: text, audio, video.
