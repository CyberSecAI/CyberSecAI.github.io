# Software Engineering Reimagined


!!! overview

    In the early stages of GenAI implementation, organizations tend to "shoehorn" GenAI's advanced capabilities into existing workflows and processes. 
    
    - They essentially use powerful new tools to perform the same tasks slightly more efficiently, without fundamentally reimagining what's possible.

    However, the true transformative potential of generative AI emerges when we recognize that it won't simply augment our current operational modelsâ€”it will radically reshape them. 

    - The "way of doing things" inevitably undergoes profound change as the technology matures and its implications become more apparent.

    For effective GenAI strategy, organizations must simultaneously:

    - Address immediate needs by applying AI to current processes
    - Anticipate and design for entirely new operational paradigms that will emerge
    
    This dual focus ensures solutions remain relevant not just for today's challenges, but for the transformed landscape that GenAI will ultimately create.

    This section is hands on walk through of Software Engineering for a Greenfield application using GenAI.

## BMad Workflows

Having reviewed and played with some of the [SWE agents](swe_agents_report.md), the BMAD-Method was closest to my views on Software 1.0 Redux, so this is used here.

There's 2 [BMad Workflows](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/core-architecture.md#51-the-planning-workflow).

### [The Planning Workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/core-architecture.md#51-the-planning-workflow) 
   
!!! quote "Key Planning Phases"

    - Optional Analysis: Analyst conducts market research and competitive analysis
    - Project Brief: Foundation document created by Analyst or user
    - PRD Creation: PM transforms brief into comprehensive product requirements
    - Architecture Design: Architect creates technical foundation based on PRD
    - Validation & Alignment: PO ensures all documents are consistent and complete
    - Refinement: Updates to epics, stories, and documents as needed
    - Environment Transition: Critical switch from web UI to IDE for development workflow
    - Document Preparation: PO shards large documents for development consumption

!!! note

    The created documents do include checks on these items, but a more detailed focused analysis can also be with these documents done before "The Core Development Cycle".

    - Security & Compliance 
    - Accessibility Implementation



    

### [The Core Development Cycle](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/core-architecture.md#52-the-core-development-cycle)

!!! quote "Key Planning Phases"

    When to move to the IDE: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! 

BMAD method breaks down the requirements and other upstream artifacts into epics and stories, enabling Claude Code to generate structured code and docs with little human intervention ([Level 4 Autonomy](./code/code_assistant_agents.md#autonomy-levels-for-ai-coding-tools)).


### Other Claude Code Workflows

There are other Claude Code workflows, some example are given here.

There are UI tools built on GIT worktrees to support this.

### Other non-Claude Code Workflows

## Phase 0: Existing Exploratory Documentation

In the exploratory part of the project at the start I had some [existing documentation](https://github.com/CWE-ChatBot/CWE-ChatBot/blob/main/README.md#additional-documentation):

1. A Cost Analysis was created by using 
      1. ChatGPT and Gemini **Reasoning** models to create an analysis
      2. Getting them to cross-review each other's output and amending their own output as a result
      3. Then taking the amended ChatGPT version as it was more succinct which is what I was looking for.
      4. The cost analysis was a back-of-napkin effort to understand likely operational costs early to see if these were a show-stopper or not.
2. Research Documents using ChatGPT and Gemini **Research** models and Anthropic
3. ADRs using an existing competed example I liked, and redoing it for the architecture decisions I had made using ChatGPT and Gemini **Reasoning** models and Anthropic.
4. Some Functional Requirements and use cases and user stories (in a Doc format) from MITRE CWE team.

!!! tip

    I worked the existing document content into the [The Planning Workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/core-architecture.md#51-the-planning-workflow) by providing the content to the BMAD Persona at the relevant time via the prompt.


## Phase 1 : [BMAD The Planning Workflow](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/docs/core-architecture.md#51-the-planning-workflow) 

Here we build the [Upstream Software Engineering Artifacts](./software_artifacts.md).

Specifically these are the [artifacts](https://github.com/CWE-ChatBot/CWE-ChatBot/blob/main/README.md#project-documentation) that are built with the workflow below.


### Setup

The [BMAD-METHOD](./swe_agents_report.md) is used.

Specifically, the [Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD?tab=readme-ov-file#fastest-start-web-ui-full-stack-team-at-your-disposal-2-minutes) part where you create a Gemini GEM with a [BMAD-provided text file](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD/blob/main/dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt).

- All these documents are created via a browser interface (Gemini GEM) so the process is IDE-independent!
- Gemini's long-context window allows it to keep the various documents produced in context so it can make consistent changes across them all.

!!! Success

    I was impressed how well this setup worked! 

    - following a logical workflow and prompting for choices or input at each stage (and not getting lost)
    - allowing me to request Gemini Gem to output a document at any time (so I could review and version control it before changes)
    - allowing me to refine the content or ask questions across all the documents as required e.g. if I suggested a change that impacted multiple documents then this was detected by Gemini and the updates made. This ensured consistency across the artefacts.

Some choices / decisions were delibertate postponed e.g. data exchange formats and schemas per [Principle #3 - Assume variability; preserve options](https://framework.scaledagile.com/assume-variability-preserve-options/). This results in a PARTIAL Status at this point.

## Phase 2: Security Review

BMAD-Method did not have a dedicated Security persona or security documents.

Other [Threat Modeling](./threat_model.md) solutions could be used to create these security documents

- See example [security artifacts](https://github.com/CWE-ChatBot/CWE-ChatBot/tree/main/docs/security) 


!!! tip

    The different solutions had different features I liked, so I decided to build a BMAD Method Security Agent with all the features I wanted.

    The BMAD Method Security Agent is part of the The BMAD Planning Workflow

    - It reviews the existing documents, creates security documents including threat models, security test cases, and security updates to the architecture document.

### Adding a BMAD Method Security Agent

I added a Security Agent to BMAD per [commits](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/commits/feature/add-new-agent-security) from Crashedmind. The commit descriptions give the details.

You can browse through the files:

- [Security Agent](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/tree/feature/add-new-agent-security/bmad-core/tasks)
- [Security Tasks](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/blob/feature/add-new-agent-security/bmad-core/agents/security.md)

### Building the Bundles

The [builder](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/tree/feature/add-new-agent-security/tools/builders) gathers all the relevant files for all the agents into single files in  https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/tree/feature/add-new-agent-security/dist/teams

- e.g. [team-fullstack.txt](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/blob/feature/add-new-agent-security/dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) contains all the agents including security, and all the other files they need.

### Create a Gemini Gem with the FullStack team
- https://gemini.google.com/
- Explore Gems
- New Gems
- CopyNPaste [team-fullstack.txt](https://github.com/CyberSecAI/BMAD-METHOD/blob/feature/add-new-agent-security/dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) into instructions
- Save

### Using the BMAD Method Security Agent via the Gemini Gem with FullStack team

1. Collate the project brief, prd, architecture etc... md files into one file (e.g. using gitingest)
2. At the prompt say "here's my existing documentation" and copyNpaste the collated md file into the prompt
3. Click the Submit Arrow
4. The workflow kicks off
