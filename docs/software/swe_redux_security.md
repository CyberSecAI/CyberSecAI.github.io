# Software Engineering 1.0 Redux Security


!!! overview

    This section covers the software security touchpoints using these references (books that were formative in my career)

    - [Secure Programming with Static Analysis by Brian Chess, Jacob West](https://www.amazon.com/Secure-Programming-Static-Analysis-Brian/dp/0321424778)
    - [Software Security: Building Security In, by Gary McGraw](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Security-Building-Gary-McGraw/dp/0321356705)
    

    It applies these to the BMAD Method

The best way to find a particular defect depends on whether it is generic or context specific, and whether 
it is visible in the code or only in the design.
