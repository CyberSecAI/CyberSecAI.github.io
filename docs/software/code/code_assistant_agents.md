# AI Coding Tools

!!! abstract "Overview"

    This page gives a comparison of Coding Assistants vs. Autonomous Coding Agents

    It starts by defining Autonomy Levels for AI Coding Tools.

    Then it categorizes and compares these AI Coding Tools based on these Autonomy Levels


## **Autonomy Levels for AI Coding Tools**

We define autonomy levels similar to [how autonomous driving is categorized](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/levels-of-code-ai):

* **Level 1 – Basic Code Completion:** AI offers *single-line or small code suggestions* based on context. The developer is fully in control, and the AI assists with micro-tasks (comparable to basic cruise control in cars). Tools at this level accelerate typing but **do not generate complex code blocks or make decisions**.
* **Level 2 – Advanced Code Generation (AI Pair Programmer):** AI can produce *larger code snippets or entire functions* from natural language prompts or broader context. The AI behaves like a junior pair programmer – it writes significant blocks of code or fixes simple bugs on request, but **each AI output is a single-step operation reviewed by the human**. Developers still guide the overall structure and verify the results.
* **Level 3 – Context-Aware Agents (Supervised Automation):** AI acts more *agentically*, performing **multi-step coding tasks** in an iterative loop to fulfill a high-level goal. The developer provides a goal (e.g. “Add a profile feature” or “Fix this bug”) and the AI **plans steps, writes or edits multiple files, runs code or tests, debugs, and iterates** with minimal prompting. The human oversees the process and may intervene or review final changes, but does not micromanage each step. This is akin to an intern or junior dev autonomously coding under supervision.
* **Level 4 – Highly Autonomous Coding:** The AI can handle **complex projects end-to-end**, needing only minimal human input (like a prompt or spec) and *no required oversight on each change*. It can design solutions, write code across the entire codebase, test, debug, and even proactively improve code without awaiting human review. At this level, you might trust the AI as you would a strong senior engineer: provide requirements and let it deliver a solution to review. (In practice, developers may still do a final review, but the AI’s output is intended to be production-ready.)
* **Level 5 – Full Autonomy (Experimental/Future):** At this theoretical stage, an AI coding agent **sets its own goals and continuously improves software** without explicit human-defined tasks. It could analyze user needs or system metrics and autonomously decide to implement features or optimizations. This remains speculative – current tools do **not** reach Level 5, but research projects hint at this direction (e.g. AutoGPT agents that take an open-ended goal and break it into sub-tasks to achieve it). No mainstream coding tool today operates at full Level 5 autonomy.

| **ChatGPT (with dev plugins)**  | 3 (Agentic – supervised) | Conversational AI (web UI or API) with plugins (code exec, filesystem, etc.)   | Highly flexible multi-tool agent: can fetch docs, run code, use Git, all in one dialogue; strong natural language understanding and reasoning (GPT-4); adapts to many tasks (coding, DevOps, research).                                                                                                                         | Not integrated into IDE by default – context sharing is manual (except via plugins); may produce verbose or tangential output; plugin reliability varies; and it’s gated by ChatGPT Plus access and plugin availability. Oversight needed as it’s not tailor-made for your specific codebase unless you feed it.                                                                         |
| **Aider (CLI + Git assistant)** | 3 (Agentic – supervised) | CLI chat tool working on local repo (Git-integrated)                           | Excellent for code modifications with safety – auto-commits each change with meaningful messages, auto-runs tests and fixes issues on the fly; supports connecting to powerful models (Claude/GPT-4) or local LLMs; free and open-source, highly configurable.                                                                  | Primarily command-line – less visual; initial setup of API keys required; if tests are lacking, its auto-fix won’t catch all errors; model errors can still slip through (needs review of commits, which fortunately are broken down for you).                                                                                                                                           |
| **Amazon Q Developer CLI**      | 3 (Agentic – supervised) | Interactive CLI agent (natural language to CLI commands & code edits)          | Lets AI control CLI tools: can compile, run, deploy and iterate using system tools; great for cloud and devops tasks (deep AWS integration); uses Claude’s strong reasoning via Bedrock; keeps conversation context for complex troubleshooting.                                                                                | Mac/Linux only currently; executing commands automatically has inherent risk (needs user trust or dry-runs); may require AWS-specific setup; not GUI – suited for those comfortable in terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Google Jules**                | 4 (High Autonomy)        | Cloud-based agent (async tasks, GitHub-connected)                              | *Fully autonomous coding agent:* given a goal it reads code, writes new code or tests, and delivers changes with minimal prompts. Great at large-scale tasks (e.g. adding major features, writing extensive tests) without micro-management. Backed by Google’s AI expertise and integrated with common workflows (GitHub PRs). | Very new (beta) – real-world performance still being proven; works off-premises (code goes to Google cloud workspace); lack of real-time interaction (you assign task and wait) can be less predictable; no guarantee it perfectly meets intent – still should do final code review.                                                                                                     |
| **Cognition Devin**             | 4 (High Autonomy)        | Cloud AI service acting as a team dev (task assignment model)                  | Ambitious scope: plans and executes complex tasks with long-term reasoning; uses tools (editor, browser, shell) like a human engineer; can produce documentation and answer code questions (not just code); has shown ability to build small apps end-to-end and fix known bugs autonomously.                                   | Expensive enterprise tool (pricing and usage limits apply); struggled with truly complex or novel problems – not infallible, success rate on tough issues still low (\~14% in benchmarks); requires handing over code access to third-party; outcomes can be hit-or-miss, demanding human validation despite the “autonomous” label.                                                     |
| **GPT-Engineer (open-source)**  | 4 (High Autonomy)        | CLI tool – one prompt to codebase generation (iterative plan/spec/code)        | Can bootstrap entire project from a single prompt, automating the role of developer given clear specs; extensible and adaptable (developers can insert custom reasoning steps); showcases how far a single-run agent can go for certain tasks.                                                                                  | Highly dependent on prompt quality; not reliable for complex applications without iteration – may generate incomplete or incorrect systems that need debugging; no ongoing conversation (one-shot run), so if it’s off-track, it may fail without asking for guidance unlike Level 3 agents. More a tech demo currently.                                                                 |
| **AutoGPT (for coding tasks)**  | 4 (High Autonomy)        | Self-directed AI agent (goal-driven loop), uses tools including code execution | Fully automated workflow: given an objective, it breaks into sub-tasks and executes them in a loop. For coding, it can write, run, and fix code iteratively without human prompts, striving to meet the goal (e.g. “create a Python script for X”).                                                                             | Tends to be inefficient and sometimes veers off-course without human feedback; can get stuck in loops or produce suboptimal solutions; not specialized for coding (uses general planning, which might not incorporate best coding practices); requires careful prompt setup and often a lot of computing resources (many API calls). Mainly experimental – not a plug-and-play dev tool. |


!!! note

    Tools at **Level 5** are omitted above since none are productized yet; future AI dev agents might eventually populate that row once they emerge.

    This comparison underscores that as we progress from Level 1 to Level 4, AI tools take on more of the coding burden — from merely completing the next line of code to handling whole features. Developers today can mix and match these tools to suit their needs, but it’s crucial to understand each tool’s autonomy and limits to use them effectively. The field is evolving rapidly, and what is Level 3 today may become Level 4 tomorrow. Keeping an eye on these autonomy levels helps set expectations and guides us in adopting AI tools that truly enhance productivity while maintaining quality and control in software development.
