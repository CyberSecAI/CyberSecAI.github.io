# AI Coding Tools

!!! abstract "Overview"

    This page gives a comparison of AI Coding Tools by Autonomy Levels.

    It starts by defining Autonomy Levels for AI Coding Tools.

    Then it categorizes and compares these AI Coding Tools based on these Autonomy Levels

!!! observation

    Current [integrated development environments (IDEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) are optimized for human programmers.

    They are not optimal  

    - For [Software Engineering Artifacts in the AI Era](../../software/software_artifacts.md)
    - For shared understanding among stakeholders
    - As we move [From Code-Centric to Contract-Centric Development](../introduction.md#from-code-centric-to-contract-centric-development)



Since I made this observation, there have been some relevant updates:

- Amazon Kiro introduces [a “spec-driven development” philosophy](https://garysvenson09.medium.com/kiro-by-amazon-rethinking-the-ai-coding-ide-landscape-ed357628b71e)
- Sean Grove, OpenAI, July 2025 discuuses [The New Code](https://youtu.be/8rABwKRsec4?si=bVyUlwN6XsRnvzkp) where specifications, not traditional code, are the primary valuable artifact for aligning human and AI intent.
    - Future IDEs might function as "integrated thought clarifiers," helping to surface and resolve ambiguities in specifications.
    - Moving from disparate machine encodings to a unified human encoding (specifications) will simplify how we solve problems.
- "There's a good chance that, by the end of the year, people aren't using IDEs anymore", [Mastering Claude Code in 30 minutes](https://youtu.be/6eBSHbLKuN0?t=1586), Anthropic, 22 May 2025

## **Autonomy Levels for AI Coding Tools**

We define autonomy levels similar to [how autonomous driving is categorized](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/levels-of-code-ai):

* **Level 1 – Basic Code Completion:** AI offers *single-line or small code suggestions* based on context. The developer is fully in control, and the AI assists with micro-tasks (comparable to basic cruise control in cars). Tools at this level accelerate typing but **do not generate complex code blocks or make decisions**.
* **Level 2 – Advanced Code Generation (AI Pair Programmer):** AI can produce *larger code snippets or entire functions* from natural language prompts or broader context. The AI behaves like a junior pair programmer – it writes significant blocks of code or fixes simple bugs on request, but **each AI output is a single-step operation reviewed by the human**. Developers still guide the overall structure and verify the results.
* **Level 3 – Context-Aware Agents (Supervised Automation):** AI acts more *agentically*, performing **multi-step coding tasks** in an iterative loop to fulfill a high-level goal. The developer provides a goal (e.g. “Add a profile feature” or “Fix this bug”) and the AI **plans steps, writes or edits multiple files, runs code or tests, debugs, and iterates** with minimal prompting. The human oversees the process and may intervene or review final changes, but does not micromanage each step. This is akin to an intern or junior dev autonomously coding under supervision.
* **Level 4 – Highly Autonomous Coding:** The AI can handle **complex projects end-to-end**, needing only minimal human input (like a prompt or spec) and *no required oversight on each change*. It can design solutions, write code across the entire codebase, test, debug, and even proactively improve code without awaiting human review. At this level, you might trust the AI as you would a strong senior engineer: provide requirements and let it deliver a solution to review. (In practice, developers may still do a final review, but the AI’s output is intended to be production-ready.)
* **Level 5 – Full Autonomy (Experimental/Future):** At this theoretical stage, an AI coding agent **sets its own goals and continuously improves software** without explicit human-defined tasks. It could analyze user needs or system metrics and autonomously decide to implement features or optimizations. This remains speculative – current tools do **not** reach Level 5, but research projects hint at this direction (e.g. AutoGPT agents that take an open-ended goal and break it into sub-tasks to achieve it). No mainstream coding tool today operates at full Level 5 autonomy.

**Comparison Table of Developer AI Tools by Autonomy and Capabilities**

The following table provides a summarized comparison of the developer AI tools discussed in this report, categorized by their primary autonomy level and highlighting their key characteristics, interaction styles, strengths, and limitations. This table serves as a quick reference to differentiate the capabilities and intended use cases of various tools in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted software development. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for developers and engineering leaders seeking to effectively integrate AI into their workflows.

!!! note

    Tools at **Level 5** are omitted from the table as no productized examples currently exist; this level remains theoretical and experimental.)*

    This comparison underscores that as we progress from Level 1 to Level 4, AI tools take on more of the coding burden — from merely completing the next line of code to handling whole features. Developers today can mix and match these tools to suit their needs, but it’s crucial to understand each tool’s autonomy and limits to use them effectively. The field is evolving rapidly, and what is Level 3 today may become Level 4 tomorrow. Keeping an eye on these autonomy levels helps set expectations and guides us in adopting AI tools that truly enhance productivity while maintaining quality and control in software development.
