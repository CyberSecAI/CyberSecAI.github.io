!!! abstract "Overview"

    This section gives an overview of Software Security today, and what it could look like in the future.

    Shift Left Testing is not sufficient.


## Shift Left Testing to Lag Earlier

!!! quote

    Shift-left testing is an approach to software testing and system testing in which testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (i.e. moved left on the project timeline). It is the first half of the maxim "test early and often"

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing

**Shift-left Testing is a lagging activity** (by definition) i.e. measure past outcomes earlier in the SDLC.

- A lagging indicator is a metric that measures past performance or outcomes, reflecting what has already happened. In other words, it shows the symptoms.


Shift Left Security Testing is a DevSecOps practice that integrates security testing early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

- Shift Left Security Testing is necessary, but not sufficient; and definitely not efficient for remediation of CyberSecurity risk.


## Leading Levers

Leading indicators are measures that change before outcomes. Think of them as proactive measures that focus on the activities and processes that can influence outcomes, rather than just measuring results after the fact. 

- A Leading Lever is adjusted, it influences the system, and the lagging indicators change as a result, giving feedback to the operator.

The question is what Levers we need to use to address the symptoms?
1. What are the Root Causes?
2. Where are the Paretos?
3. What are the top 3 things to remediate to give the biggest reduction in organization risk?
