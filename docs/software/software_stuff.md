## From Shift-Left Testing to Earlier Lag Indicators

!!! quote

    Shift-left testing is an approach to software testing and system testing in which testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (i.e. moved left on the project timeline). It is the first half of the maxim "test early and often."

    [Shift-left testing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing)

**Shift-left testing is inherently a lagging activity** by definition—it measures past outcomes earlier in the SDLC rather than preventing issues from occurring.

A lagging indicator is a metric that measures past performance or outcomes, reflecting what has already happened. In other words, it reveals the symptoms rather than addressing root causes.

Shift-left security testing is a DevSecOps practice that integrates security testing early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). While this approach is necessary, it is neither sufficient nor efficient for remediating cybersecurity risk.

## Leading Levers for Security

Leading indicators are measures that change before outcomes occur. They function as proactive measures that focus on the activities and processes that influence outcomes, rather than simply measuring results after the fact.

A leading lever, when adjusted, influences the system and causes lagging indicators to change as a result, providing feedback to the operator.

The critical question is: what levers do we need to use to address the symptoms?

1. What are the root causes?
2. Where are the Pareto distributions? (What follows the 80/20 rule?)
3. What are the top three remediation priorities that will deliver the biggest reduction in organizational risk?

## CyberSecurity Industry Reimagined
In the early stages of GenAI implementation, organizations tend to "shoehorn" these advanced capabilities into existing workflows and processes. They essentially use powerful new tools to perform the same tasks slightly more efficiently, without fundamentally reimagining what's possible.
However, the true transformative potential of generative AI emerges when we recognize that it won't simply augment our current operational models—it will radically reshape them. The "way of doing things" inevitably undergoes profound change as the technology matures and its implications become more apparent.
For effective GenAI strategy, organizations must simultaneously:
Address immediate needs by applying AI to current processes
Anticipate and design for entirely new operational paradigms that will emerge
This dual focus ensures solutions remain relevant not just for today's challenges, but for the transformed landscape that GenAI will ultimately create.
