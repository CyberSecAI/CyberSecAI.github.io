# Prompt Engineering

!!! abstract "Overview"

    A large part of working LLMs is knowing how to prompt them to get the information you want.

    ChatGPTo will be used here but the techniques apply in general to any LLM.

  

## Use the LLM for more than answering the question
There are many books, guides, and articles on Prompt Engineering - some of the better ones are listed in the References section below.

Some points I've found useful that I don't see described often are:

1. Ask the LLM to generate the prompt.
      1. Do this in 2 parts (task decomposition)
         1. Ask the LLM what techniques are best to use for effective prompt engineering
         2. Ask the LLM to create a prompt using these techniques for the objective and example you specify
2. Ask the LLM to approach the problem step by step, and to provide the rationale for their response
3. Ask the LLM to provide a confidence score for their answer. 
      1. People can be fooled by the fluency of LLMs aka hallucinations 
      2. LLMs know how confident they are.
      3. So asking an LLM to rate their confidence in the answer can reduce blind trust.
4. Ask the LLM (or a different LLM) to review the answer and provide improvements.

_functions.php in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a redirect but does not exit when it is called directly, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism to conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary PHP code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2003-1500.


#CVE# _functions.php in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a redirect but does not exit when it is called directly, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism to conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary PHP code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2003-1500.
#IMPACT# Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Security Bypass
#RATIONALE# The description specifies multiple potential impacts:
1. **Remote Code Execution**: The ability to "execute arbitrary PHP code" directly implies a high severity impact where an attacker can run malicious code on the affected system.
2. **Information Disclosure**: The mention of "read arbitrary files" suggests that attackers can access sensitive information stored in files.
3. **Security Bypass**: The bypass of a protection mechanism to conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks implies that security controls are being circumvented.
