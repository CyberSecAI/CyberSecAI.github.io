!!! quote
    Since the start of 2023 and GenAI we've seen a massive number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. It's powerful, but it's not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives.

    In other words, AI doesn't have a capabilities problemâ€”it has an integration problem.
    Fabric was created to address this by enabling everyone to granularly apply AI to everyday challenges.

    One of fabric's primary features is helping people collect and integrate prompts, which we call Patterns, into various parts of their lives.

The prompts (aka Patterns) are available at https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns
