## I want to rank vulnerabilities by Exploitation

!!! quote
    
    I am currently using CVSS to rank vulnerabilities. I also want to rank based on exploitation as I heard only a small percentage of CVEs are actually exploited. What standard should I use. How should I use them. Provide an answer with rationale and examples.

## Explain risk like I'm a 5 year old

!!! quote
    
    I want to prioritize vulnerabilities by risk. But I don't understand risk and the components or factors of risk. Can you explain that to me like I'm a 5 year old. Then explain how I can use that for my risk based prioritization approach. Please provide a rationale

## Takeaways
  
!!! success "Takeaways" 

    1. NotebookLM does a good job assimilating these verbose standards and was competently able to answer specific factual questions, and broader opinionated questions.
    2. Lots of references to the source material were provided in the answers which help understand and validate the answers.
