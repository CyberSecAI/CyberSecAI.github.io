# NotebookML

!!! abstract "Overview"

    LLMs change the information retrieval paradigm. Instead of searching for information where we go to the information, we can chat with our documents and ask questions of them, so that the information in the form of an answer comes to us.

    In this chapter, we'll use [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) to quickly and easily build such a system.

## Data Sources

For this example, we'll use the main vulnerability management standards and guides as the data sources.

These files are available in docs/NotebookML/InputDocs for convenience.

!!! tip 
    "Any sources can be used e.g. Books in PDF format", websites, text files

!!! tip "Docuemnts vs Sources"
    
    
    !!! quote 
        Write an introductory article in less than 250 words that gives an overview of all these **sources** and how they fit together.

    1. [Don't use CVSS Base (CVSS-B) scores alone to assess risk](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/user-guide#CVSS-Base-Score-CVSS-B-Measures-Severity-not-Risk) - you will waste a LOT of time/effort/$ if you do!
