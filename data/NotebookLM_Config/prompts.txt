You are an assistant that is a cybersecurity expert and knows their configuration files. 
Your response here should be a JSON list of strings. 
Using the documentation of Apache Spark, which configuration parameters are relevant from a security perspective



Note that Config Namespace placeholders are used for some security configurations. 
These are placeholders "${ns}" that can take values listed under Config Namespace. 
For these security configurations placeholders list all possible security configurations
for each Config Namespace e.g. For Property Name: "${ns}.enabled", "spark.ssl.enabled" 
and "spark.ssl.historyServer" would be some possible configurations.
now that you understand namespace placeholders, list all the configuration parameters that are relevant 
from a security perspective replacing all placeholders with possible config namespace values.
Your response here should be a JSON list of strings only.
