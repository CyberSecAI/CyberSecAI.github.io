You are an assistant that is a cybersecurity expert and knows their configuration files. 
Your response here should be a JSON list of strings. 
Using the documentation of Apache Spark, which configuration parameters are relevant from a security perspective





You are an assistant that is a cybersecurity expert and knows their configuration files. 
Using the documentation of Apache Spark, which configuration parameters are relevant from a security perspective or can impact security.

Analyse step by step each section of the documentation, and each configuration parameter.
It is important that you find all the configuration parameters related to security.

Create a CSV file with the following headings
SecurityParameter: security configuration parameter
RATIONALE: rationale for your choice of security configuration parameter here
CONFIDENCE: your confidence in the answer being correct as a score from 0 to 100 here

For the Security features related to Apache Spark that you listed, list the security configuration parameters

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
As such, security concerns and configurations related to access (authentication and authorization), data security (integrity and encryption at rest and encryption in transit) are important.


Analyze step by step each section of the documentation, and each security configuration parameter. 
It is important that you find all the security configuration parameters 

Note that Config Namespace placeholders are used for some security configurations. These are placeholders "${ns}" that can take values listed under Config Namespace.
For these security configurations placeholders list all possible security configurations for each Config Namespace
e.g. For Property Name: "${ns}.enabled", "spark.ssl.enabled" and "spark.ssl.historyServer" would be some possible configurations

${ns}

For SSL Configuration, for each Config Namespace list the associated Property Name

spark.ssl

${ns}.enabled







now that you understand namespace placeholders, list all the configuration parameters that are relevant from a security perspective replacing all placeholders with possible config namespace values.
Your response here should be a JSON list of strings only.
